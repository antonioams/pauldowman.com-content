Did you know that you can enable access logging on [S3][10]? Did you know that
you can add arbitrary metadata to objects in S3? Did you know that you can
serve compressed content from S3?

[The S3 Cookbook][11], an e-book written by [Scott Patten][12], has easy-to-
follow recipes to do those and about 60 other things (including one that I
contributed for backing up a MySQL database to S3). In addition to the
recipes, it also has chapters on S3's architecture, authenticating S3
requests, and an overview of the S3 API.

It's published on [Sopobo][15], a new platform for authors to self-publish
technical books (that also happens to be created by Scott!). Sopobo includes
tools for readers to interact with each other and with the author. If I were
writing a book that I planned to shop around to a few publishers I'd seriously
consider putting it on there first to get some feedback (and make a few bucks)
before it got picked up.
