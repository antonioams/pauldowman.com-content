Here is a list of books that I recommend to anyone interested in software
development. Some of these are books that I read a long time ago so your
mileage may vary, but every book here has had a positive effect on my career at
some point so this list will at least give you some idea of my interests and
perspective.

  * _[Getting Real](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0578012812/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0578012812) by [37signals](http://37signals.com/)_. For developers and non-developers alike (it's not a technical book), this book explains 37signals' product development philosophy of keeping things simple. You can also [read it free online](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/).
  * _[Rework](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0307463745) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson_. More 37signals philosophy on work and business. A quick read, it's a collection of one- or two-page essays such as "Meetings are Toxic" and "ASAP is Poison". You might find them obvious, or you might completely disagree with them, but I'm sure it will provoke some thought and I highly recommend it to everyone.
  * _[Running Lean](http://www.runningleanhq.com/) by Ash Maurya_. Starting a startup? Developing a product? Here's a method to help ensure that you build only what your customers want.
  * _[Pro Git](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218339/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1430218339) by Scott Chacon_. The best way to learn [Git](http://git-scm.com/) that I've found anywhere. Written by Scott Chacon of [GitHub](http://github.com/) It's also available for [free download or online reading](http://progit.org/book/)
  * _[The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=020161622X) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas._ Absolute must-know fundamentals. Short, to-the-point, and enjoyable to read. Experienced developers should read this too, it's a quick and easy read and even if you think you know it all you'll probably still get something out of it.
  * _[Building Scalable Web Sites](http://pauldowman.com/2006/11/12/building-scalable-web-sites-book/) by Cal Henderson._ If you develop web-based software you must read this! Again it mostly covers basics, but like [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=020161622X) it's an excellent survey of all the fundamental issues and even experienced developers will probably find it worth skimming through.
  * _[Scalable Internet Architectures](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067232699X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=067232699X) by Theo Schlossnagle_. This is a dense book, packed with info about building large-scale web sites. Even if you don't use any of the specific technologies that he describes, this book is worth reading for a good general understanding of scalable architectures.
  * _[The Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0201835959) by Frederick P. Brooks._ A classic compilation of essays about software development, first published in 1975. Although still very relevant, it's also a fascinating historical view of software development.
  * _[The Rails 3 Way](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601661/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321601661) by Obie Fernandez_. If you're learning Ruby on Rails get this book first. If you're developing Rails applications get this book. Enough said.
  * _[ppk on JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321423305/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321423305) by Peter-Paul Koch_. The best book I've read on JavaScript, written by the maintainer of the excellent [quirksmode.org](http://www.quirksmode.org/). The book covers the fundamentals of the JavaScript language, DOM scripting, browser scripting, usability and accessability. The writing style is very clear and concise and there is a lot of interesting historical context throughout.
  * _[Database in Depth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100124/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0596100124) by C. J. Date._ The fundamentals of relational database theory, and interesting (if not strictly practical) discussion of how SQL's support for the relational model is "deficient".
  * _[Extreme Programming Explained (2nd Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321278658) by Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres._ Changed significantly from the first edition, this is a good overview of the ideas behind XP. Anyone who thinks they're practicing XP _must_ read this, it describes something quite different from a lot of the "XP" that I've seen practiced! Perhaps interesting for sceptics as well.
  * _[Test-Driven Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321146530) by Kent Beck._ Good explanation by example of how to let unit tests drive your design and development. Don't let the Java examples scare you away.
  * _[My Job Went to India (And All I Got Was this Lousy Book)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976694018/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0976694018) by Chad Fowler._ A short collection of entertainingly-written recipes to inspire your (software development) career and keep yourself relevant.
  * _[Hackers and Painters](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449389554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1449389554) by Paul Graham._ An eclectic collection of essays on various topics including nerds, programming language design, and high-tech startups. I think all of these essays (and many more) are [available online](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) but they're so good it's worth owning the book anyway.
  * _[Founders at Work](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210788/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1430210788) by Jessica Livingston._ This is an interesting collection of interviews with founders of influential and successful technology companies. It's quite long because it's unedited transcripts of interviews but it's interesting. It's definitely required reading for anyone starting a startup.
  * _[Accidental Empires](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887308554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0887308554) by Robert X. Cringely._ A book about the history of the personal computer, especially one written in 1992, should not be this entertaining! But it's incredibly enjoyable to read, even now. Perhaps that's because Cringely trashes every one of his characters in an entertaining way, showing them as flawed and human, while still acknowledging their accomplishments and the influence they've had. Since it was actually written at the end of the first wave of the PC revolution, before the Internet era, it offers a different perspective on that time than a book written today. It makes a good companion to [Founders at Work](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430210788/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1430210788).
  * _[Dealers of Lightning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887309895/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0887309895) by Michael A. Hiltzik._ A long but interesting history of the famous [Xerox Palo Alto Research Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_PARC) and the people behind it. The cast includes many incredibly influential pioneers of the computer industry such as [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), [Robert Metcalfe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe), [Douglas Engelbart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart), etc.
  * _[Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0142000280) by David Allen._ Really the point of this one isn't making yourself more productive it's about lowering your stress. If you often feel you have too much to do, and not enough time to do it, here's how to regain a feeling of control. It's about meeting external demands with less effort.
  * _[Presentation Zen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321525655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0321525655) by Garr Reynolds_. This is a very quick read and it will help you avoid inflicting "death by Powerpoint". Your audience will applaud you.
  * _[Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060512806/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0060512806) by Neal Stephenson._ FICTION. Take a break and read this! It's a really fun story, or rather two stories that gradually join together into one. The first plot-line follows some cryptographers in World War II, and the second revolves around a modern-day high-tech startup. There's a ton of action, adventure, romance and entertainment, but also a lot of surprisingly accurate cryptography and computer security concepts.
  * _[Brain over Brawn](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984258302/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0984258302) by Clint Cornelius_. When I'm not coding or reading I like to stay healthy (in spite of all the coding and reading!), and this is the best overall book I've found about fitness, exercise, and healthy habits in general. It has a distinctly different viewpoint from anything else I've read on the subject. It's also available as a [free e-book](http://brainoverbrawn.com/).
