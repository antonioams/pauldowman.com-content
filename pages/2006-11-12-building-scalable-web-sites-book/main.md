When [Building Scalable Web
Sites](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596102356/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=pauldowmancom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0596102356)
came out earlier this year (written by [Cal Henderson][11] of [Flickr][12]) I
was immediately interested because I'm totally fascinated with the architecture
of very large scale systems. But a quick browse through the [table of
contents][13] changed my mind, it looked really basic and there were only two
chapters dedicated to the "scalable" part of the subject. I was interested
because the title was "Building _Scalable_ Web Sites", not just "Building Web
Sites".

But I happened to pick it up in a book store recently and actually flip
through it a bit, and it looked interesting so I bought it. I'm glad I did, it
was a surprisingly good read. It reminds me a bit of [The Pragmatic
Programmer][14]: most of the material is fairly basic, but it's worth reading
even for experts because it's well written, reasonably short, yet quite
thorough.

It focuses mainly on PHP and MySQL (on Linux), but really this book is about
general principles not implementation details, and those principles are
equally applicable to other languages and platforms.

For a list of other technical books that I recommend, take a look at my
[reading][15] page.
