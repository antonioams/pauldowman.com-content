I'll be speaking at the [FutureRuby][10] conference, which will be held in
Toronto from July 9-12. If it's anything like last year's RubyFringe
conference (also put on by the hard-working [Unspace][11] crew) it will be a
great time, and anything but your standard tech conference.

I'm looking forward to hearing some great [talks][12] and meeting lots of
interesting new people (the [evening events][13] alone are worth the price of
the ticket!).
