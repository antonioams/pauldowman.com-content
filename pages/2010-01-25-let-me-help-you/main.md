I've just spent an exciting three years developing [GigPark][9] (which was
recently named one of the [top 10 Toronto web startups of 2009][10]) and
managing the integration and transition to it's new owners since the
[acquisition in August][11].

Now I'm moving on to new challenges, and I'm available for contract work.

Do you need help with:

  * Web application performance and scalability?
  * Software development using Ruby? (I also have a lot of experience with Java and a variety of other languages and tools.)
  * System architecture?
  * Cloud computing, EC2 and Amazon web services?

Do you need someone to lead a software development team or help with an Agile
software development process?

I have experience with all of these things and I'd be happy to help.

Please read about some of the [interesting things that I've done][12] and then
[contact me][13] to see how I can help you.
