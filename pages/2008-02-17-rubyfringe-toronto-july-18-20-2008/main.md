There's going to be a great Ruby conference in Toronto this summer:
[RubyFringe][10]. Actually, maybe it's not a Ruby conference, it's "an avant-
garde conference for developers that are excited about emerging technologies
outside of the Ruby on Rails monoculture".

   [10]: http://rubyfringe.com/

> RubyFringe is a single-track indie conference with no paid technical
sponsors and a target attendance of 150.

>

> It will run for two days (plus an opening night), with roughly 10 speakers
or panels each day.

There's a kick-ass list of [speakers][11], including out-of-towners like [Ezra
Zygmuntowicz][12], [Zed Shaw][13] (now's your chance to [fight him][14]! ;-),
[Obie Fernandez][15], and local Torontonians like [Reg Braithwaite][16] and
[Leila Boujnane][17].
