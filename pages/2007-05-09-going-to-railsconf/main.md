I'm going to [RailsConf][10] next week. If you're going, look for me at [these
sessions][11]. As usual there are a few that I'd like to go to but can't
because of conflicts:

   [10]: http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/
   [11]: http://myconfplan.com/users/pdowman/conferences/RailsConf2007

  * [Taking Rails Tests to the Next Level][12]
  * [Doing REST Right][13]
  * [JRuby on Rails][14]

   [12]: http://myconfplan.com/conference_sessions/911-Taking-Rails-Tests-to-the-Next-Level
   [13]: http://myconfplan.com/conference_sessions/9-Doing-REST-Right
   [14]: http://myconfplan.com/conference_sessions/41-JRuby-on-Rails--A-Taste-of-Honey--for-the-Enterp

I'm especially looking forward to the scaling-related (including Amazon EC2)
sessions, and [LetIt::Rest][15]. I can't wait!
