As Director of Technology I was the first employee of GigPark, which was
founded by [Pema Hegan][14] and [Noah Godfrey][15], and I'm proud to say that
together with the awesome team of [Tony Targonski][16] and [Gianni
Chiappetta][17] we have built a solid and reliable service that people love to
use.

Canpages is the fastest growing local search and directories publisher in
Canada, and their site gets more than 3.5 million unique visitors per month.
Canpages will be integrating GigPark's recommendations into its online and
mobile search platforms which means that a lot more people will be seeing
recommendations for businesses on GigPark.

Some highlights of the media coverage:

  * [TechCrunch][18]
  * [Globe and Mail][19]

  * [Toronto Star][21]
  * [BNN][22] (interview with Olivier Vincent, Canpages CEO)
