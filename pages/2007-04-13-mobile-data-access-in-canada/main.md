[Thomas Purves][10] has written about [how badly we're being screwed][11] for
data access by our three mobile operators in Canada, and [many people
agree][12]. He's completely right, mobile data access is way too expensive to
be generally useful. Even SMS is expensive at $0.15 (increased from $0.10
after our five carriers consolidated down to three).

I make do with a wi-fi-enabled mobile phone, but unfortunately wi-fi is not
really a viable mobile alternative. Open hot-spots are few and far between (or
offered by the [same three amigos][13] and priced so as not to compete with
their mobile data). I'd happily pay the flat $29/month for Toronto Hydro's
[OneZone][14], but I'm rarely inside the coverage area and it's ([by many
accounts][15] and in my own personal experience) [barely usable][16] anyway.

Canada is a great place to live for many reasons, most of which are more
important than wireless data access. But the rest of the world is at the
beginning of a mobile internet boom that Canadians are generally not taking
part in. Who knows how many more would-be entrepreneurs from our [flourishing
local tech scene][17] might be developing innovative mobile apps if they only
had the opportunity to be inspired? It's no wonder all the innovation in the
mobile space comes from [elsewhere][18].
