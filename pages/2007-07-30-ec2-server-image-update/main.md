Just a couple of announcements about my [Ruby on Rails server image for EC2][10]:

### New version

There is a new server image with some minor changes and bug fixes. For details
see the [change log][11]. I'll keep the old image around for a while.

### Mailing lists

I have created two Google groups, one for [announcements only][12] (new
versions, etc.), and one for [general discussion][13].

   [13]: http://groups.google.com/group/ec2-on-rails-discuss

### Ongoing work

I'm working on a build script so the image can be built from source. Then I
will provide access to a subversion repository with the source. Some people
have expressed an interest in contributing, which I'm really happy about! If
you want to get involved, please [join the mailing list][14]!
